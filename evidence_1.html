    <h1>Public Parks inquiry - send a submission</h1>

    <p>The Communities and Local Government Committee is looking at public parks to examine the impact of reduced local authority budgets on these open spaces and consider concerns that their existence is under threat.</p>

    <h2>What’s the inquiry looking into?</h2>

    <p class="highlight">Your submission must relate to at least one of the following points</p>

    <div class="box-input">
      <ul>
        <li>Who uses parks and open spaces, how often and for what</li>
        <li>The contribution of parks to the health and well-being of communities</li>
        <li>The impact of reductions in local authority budgets on parks</li>
        <li>What the administrative status of parks should be in light of declining local authority resources for non-statutory services</li>
        <li>How new and existing parks can best be supported</li>
        <li>What additional or alternative funding is available and what scope is there for local authorities to generate revenue from park users</li>
